## Web-Social-post-Downloader

This is my first small project in React.

Objective of this project is to learn and practice:
- javascript
- React framework
- React mui
- Python Flask
- learn and understand the interaction between front-end and back-end
- navigate between pages
- learn use states
- encode/decode base64 to utf-8
- read json data

This simple WebApp will download a social media post(image or video) by pasting the link in the field, this link will be sent to the flask app/server and processed using different libraries:
- requests
- instaloader
- youtube_dl
and send the file to the client to be downloaded.
